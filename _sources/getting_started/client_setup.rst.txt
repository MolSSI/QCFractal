QCPortal Quickstart
===============================

Installation through conda
--------------------------

The QCPortal package can be installed via `conda/anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com>`_
or `mamba <https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba>`_. The packages exist under the
`QCArchive organization <https://anaconda.org/QCArchive>`_ on Anaconda.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda create -n qcportal qcportal -c qcarchive/label/next
    $ conda activate qcportal



.. _qcportal_setup_configfile:

Configuration File
------------------

The username and password used to connect to the remote QCFractal server
can be placed in a configuration file.

The configuration file is a YAML file containing sections with a name, and then
the address and other options. The name is arbitrary and is for the user to
differentiate between different servers.

.. code-block:: yaml

   my_favorite_server:
     address: http://127.0.0.1:7777
     username: your_username 
     password: Secret_Password


The path to this file and the section name can passed to the :meth:`PortalClient.from_file <qcportal.client.PortalClient.from_file>` function.
