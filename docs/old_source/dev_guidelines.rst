Development Guidelines
======================

QCArchive developers adhere to a set of guidelines, both in the software stylistic guide, and in the outward conduct.
We are working on codifying these in a clean list here, but early guides can be as follows

Software Development Guides
---------------------------

We openly encourage development of the QCArchive and all of its projects in public discourse through GitHub and the
QCArchive Slack (|join_slack_upper|_).

All changes should be proposed through a PR to the main projects from Forks of said projects.

For more details about the development cycle and guidelines, please
`see the DevTools Readme on GitHub <https://github.com/MolSSI/QCFractal/blob/master/devtools/README.md>`_ for the
project.

Personal Conduct Guides
-----------------------

Basic rule of thumb: Be respectful, welcome people, keep all interactions harassment-free.

Please see the
`full Code of Conduct on the project's GitHub page <https://github.com/MolSSI/QCFractal/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_
for more information.
