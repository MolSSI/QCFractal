    Perform a general insert, taking into account existing data

    For each ORM object in data, check if the object/row already exists in the database. If it doesn't exist,
    add it to the database. If the row does exist, data from the existing record will be returned.
    The columns passed to search_cols will be used to determine if the data/row already exists.

    If the row does not exist, but the input record has an auto-incremented primary key set, then
    that is considered an error, and an exception is thrown. This kind of case should be handled before calling
    this function.

    A list of tuples is returned, containing data from the columns specified in ``returning`` (in that order). The order
    of the tuples themselves is the same as was given in the ``data`` list, and will correspond to rows in the database.

    The ORM object passed in through ``data`` may be modified, and they may be attached to the given session upon
    returning. Various fields may be filled in.

    The ``lock_id`` parameter is used to block other inserts into the table for the duration of this insert.
    This is used to prevent duplicate entries.

    .. note::
        This function is used for various fields, such as records. Since records are not unique, we don't
        have a unique constraint and therefore cannot use the ``on_conflict_do_nothing`` clause. Hence the need
        for manual advisory locking

    ----------
    session

        List/Iterable of ORM objects to be added to the database. These objects may be modified in-place.
