def wrap_route(
    requested_action,
) -> Callable:
    """
    Decorator that wraps a Flask route function, providing useful functionality

    This wrapper handles several things:

        1. Checks the JWT for permission to access this route (with the requested action)
        2. Parses the request body and URL params, and converts them to the appropriate model (see below)
        3. Serializes the response returned from the wrapped function into the appropriate
           type (taken from the accepted mimetypes)

    The data packaged with the request may be json, msgpack, or maybe others in the future.
    This is deserialized and converted to the types needed by the wrapped function. These
    types are read from the type annotations on the wrapped function.

    There are two function parameters that are inspected - `url_params` for the URL parameters,
    and `body_data` for data included in the request body. The type annotations for these
    parameters are read, and then pydantic is used to convert the deserialized request body/params
    into the appropriate type, after which they are passed to the function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    requested_action
        The overall type of action that this route handles (read, write, etc)
